# WOD-Predict
We're attempting to create a tool that will allow us to create models of our fitness

How to use the tool:

1.) Run the 'get_benchmarks.py' script. It will ask for your scores for a handful of common CrossFit Benchmark WODs. 

2.) Run the 'get_prediction.py' script. It will ask for a WOD that you want to get a prediction for. When finish the WOD, be sure to enter your actual score when it asks you to.
